# 3D printing Build Time Estimating
### Purpose: 

When 3D printing, the build time of a model can vary depending on its build orientation. Build time is influenced by various factors. Examples of 3D printer settings that can affect this include support structure, layer thickness, nozzle speed, infill rate, among others. Consequently, I plan to create a model that can predict build time.
